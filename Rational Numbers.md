$A = \{\frac{x}{y} | x,y \in Z, y \ne 0 \}$ $\frac{1}{2} \equiv \frac{27}{54}$ 
$\frac{x_1}{y_1} \equiv \frac{x_2}{y_2}$ if and only if $x_1y_2 = x_2y_1$ 

Def. The set Q of all rational numbers is the set of all equivalence classes of relation on A. 
E.X. 
	The set $\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{27}{54}, . . .\}$ consisting of all fractions of the kind $\frac{a}{2a}$ for all non-zero $a ∈ Z$ is an equivalence class of $∼$ on A, hence this set is a rational number.
